Facebook will launch the Libra digital currency in January 2021, according to the Financial Times FT sources.

The currency will be issued in a "cut format", the newspaper specifies. Whereas Libra was originally supposed to be backed by a basket of traditional currencies, now it will be a currency backed only by the US dollar at a 1: 1 rate.

The exact timing of the Libra launch depends on the approval of the Swiss Financial Markets Authority the Libra Association is headquartered in Geneva.
